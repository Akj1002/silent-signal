# Silent Signal
**Microsoft Imagine Cup 2025 Submission**

## The Mission
Silent Signal is a hyper-personalized mental health platform designed to bridge the gap between biological signals and psychological support. In a world where mental health struggles are often invisible, Silent Signal acts as an intelligent lifeline, using a hybrid neural architecture to monitor anxiety levels in real-time and provide immediate, agentic AI intervention.

## Core Features

### 1. Relief Pacer (Real-Time Biometrics)
The system uses simulated biometric analysis to monitor heart rate and breathing patterns. If it detects an anxiety spike, it automatically triggers calming visual exercises to regulate the user's state before panic sets in.

### 2. Dr. AI Specialist 
Unlike standard chatbots, our "Dr. AI" is a context-aware medical assistant powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**. It doesn't just answer questions; it knows your current vitals (Heart Rate & Anxiety Score) instantly, offering clinical yet empathetic guidance tailored to your physical state.

### 3. Relief Sanctuary (Multimedia Therapy)
Recovery isn't just medical; it's sensory. We built a dedicated "Relief Sanctuary" that offers:
* **The Soundscape:** Integrated audio therapy featuring binaural beats, flute meditation, and low-frequency "heal songs" to lower heart rate.
* **The Vision:** A curated video feed of guided 5-minute meditations and calming nature scapes that automatically adjusts based on the user's current mood.

### 4. Emergency SOS System
When words fail, Silent Signal speaks for you. The SOS feature activates a high-contrast emergency mode and generates a **Live Dynamic QR Code**. First responders can scan this code to instantly access the user's live health metrics (Heart Rate, Anxiety Level) without needing to unlock a phone or ask questions.

### 5. Neuro-Nutrition Engine
We believe in treating the mind through the body. The platform analyzes your stress data to recommend specific "Neuro-Nutrition" plans—suggesting foods scientifically proven to lower cortisol and support serotonin production based on your unique scan results.
