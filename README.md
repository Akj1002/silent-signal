# Silent Signal

## The Mission
Silent Signal is a hyper-personalized mental health platform designed to bridge the gap between biological signals and psychological support. In a world where mental health struggles are often invisible, Silent Signal acts as an intelligent lifeline, utilizing a **Hybrid Neural Architecture (Microsoft Azure + Google Gemini)** to monitor anxiety levels in real-time and provide immediate, agentic AI intervention.

## Core Features

### 1. Relief Pacer (Real-Time Biometrics)
The system uses simulated biometric analysis to monitor heart rate and breathing patterns. If it detects an anxiety spike, it automatically triggers calming visual exercises to regulate the user's state before panic sets in.

### 2. Dr. AI Specialist (Hybrid Intelligence)
Our medical assistant is now powered by a **Multi-Model Neural Mesh**, combining the best of two clouds:
 **Emotion Sensor (Azure AI Language):** Scientifically analyzes the user's sentiment and emotional tone before processing any text.
 **Medical Reasoning (Google Gemini 2.0):** Uses the Azure emotional data to provide context-aware, clinical guidance.
 **Neural Voice (Azure AI Speech):** Delivers advice in a calming, human-like voice, making the interaction feel like a real therapy session rather than just text on a screen.

### 3. Relief Sanctuary (Multimedia Therapy)
Recovery isn't just medical; it's sensory. We built a dedicated "Relief Sanctuary" that offers:
**The Soundscape:** Integrated audio therapy featuring binaural beats, flute meditation, and low-frequency "heal songs" to lower heart rate.
**The Vision:** A curated video feed of guided 5-minute meditations and calming nature scapes that automatically adjusts based on the user's current mood.

### 4. Emergency SOS System
When words fail, Silent Signal speaks for you. The SOS feature activates a high-contrast emergency mode and generates a **Live Dynamic QR Code**. First responders can scan this code to instantly access the user's live health metrics (Heart Rate, Anxiety Level) without needing to unlock a phone or ask questions.

### 5. Neuro-Nutrition Engine
We believe in treating the mind through the body. The platform analyzes your stress data to recommend specific "Neuro-Nutrition" plans—suggesting foods scientifically proven to lower cortisol and support serotonin production based on your unique scan results.
